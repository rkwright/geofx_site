    <h2>A Lesson in Ballistics</h2>
    <p>In the previous lesson, we saw how one can calculate the vertical position of an
    object as a function of its initial velocity and the accelerationofgravity. In this
    lesson, we will extend that concept to allow us to calulate the horizontal position
    of the object as well. To demonstrate this we will use a common application of this
    principle: ballistics.</p>
    <p>For our example we will use the cannon shown on the left. Our cannon fires a
    cannonball. This cannonball leaves the barrel of the cannon at some intial velocity
    V<sub>0</sub>. Recall that velocity is the vector that includes both the speed and
    the direction of an object. So initially, the cannonball has a velocity that includes
    both a horizontal component, V<sub>x</sub> and a vertical component,
    V<sub>y</sub>.</p>
    <p>From trigonometry, it is easy to see that we can calulate the components from the
    velocity:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>V<sub>x</sub> = V<sub>0</sub> * cos(θ)</p>
        <p>V<sub>y</sub> = V<sub>0</sub> * sin(θ)</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>where θ is the angle of the initial trajectory of the cannonball.</p>
    <p>The important point to grasp in this lesson is, as in the previous lesson, the
    forces acting on the object to not change with time (<em>as before, we ignore the
    effects of friction from the atmosphere</em>).</p>
    <p>Therefore, the position of the cannonball at any time after time t<sub>0</sub> can
    be calculated as:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>x<sub>t</sub> = V<sub>x</sub> * t</p>
        <p>y<sub>t</sub> = V<sub>y</sub> * t - 1/2 * g * t<sup>2</sup></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>where t is the time in seconds from the firing the cannon and g is the
    acceleration of gravity (9.802m/s<sup>2</sup>).</p>
    <p>Questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the initial velocity is 15m/s and the barrel angle is 50o above the horizon,
      what is the maximum height the cannonball will reach? (mouse over here for a
      hint).</li>
      <li>In the above example, how far will the ball travel before it hits the ground
      (assume the “ground”is the faint brown line, which is the elevation the cannon ball
      starts at time zero)? (mouse over here for a hint)</li>
