  <h2>Lesson 6 - One Dimensional Trajectories</h2>
    <p>This lesson, part of a "fictional" set of physics lessons, created as a demo of
    JavaScript animation of SVG. The subject is the physics of simple one-dimensional
    trajectories. The demonstration uses a "high striker" featured at carnivals and
    fairs. The artwork was created in Adobe Illustrator, exported as SVG and then
    hand-edited to add the JavaScript.</p>
    <p>The lesson consists of a HTML page which comprises the text of the lesson, laid
    out in standard HTML5. The HTML has two main <span class="inline-code">div</span>
    elements. One contains the HTML markup that is the text of the lesson. The other has
    a single HTML <span class="inline-code">object</span> tag that loads the actual SVG.
    The SVG could just be placed inline within the HTML, but for ease of editing and
    maintenance it is easier to load it with the <span class="inline-code">object</span>
    tag. One aspect to note is that the HTML <span class="inline-code">div</span> has a
    large (10em) margin where the SVG is rendered. The "SVG" <span class=
    "inline-code">div</span> is positioned absolutely so it gets composited on top of the
    HTML and appears to be beside the HTML when in fact it is on top of it, only it is in
    the margin of the HTML.</p>
    <p>The SVG in turn loads the JavaScript with the SVG <span class=
    "inline-code">script</span> object. Again, the script could be inline, but it is
    easier to maintain if separate. Also, the script could have been within the HTML, but
    it would be a little more convoluted to get a handle to the SVG's document object.
    Also, note that the SVG script object uses <span class=
    "inline-code">xlink:href</span> instead of the <span class="inline-code">src</span>
    attribute of the HTML <span class="inline-code">script</span> tag.</p>
    <pre><code class=
    "language-svg">&lt;script type="text/javascript" xlink:href="../js/lesson6.js" /&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The SVG's root <span class="inline-code">svg</span> element looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code class=
    "language-svg">&lt;svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
     x="0px" y="0px" width="280px" height="1024px" viewBox="-20 0 273.268 721.3623" onload="on_load(evt)"/&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>A few points to note. First, we need to declare the xlink namespace because it is
    needed for SVG's script element. Seond we declare the view position , which could be
    omitted as (0,0) is the default. And the <span class="inline-code">height</span> and
    <span class="inline-code">width</span>, which are essential. We also declare the
    <span class="inline-code">viewBox</span>, which are the real-world coordinates that
    are mapped to the corners of th height and width box we declare.</p>
    <p>This is needed because Illustrator creates all drawings in points and has no
    concept of coordinate systems, so we determine the coordinates of the corner of the
    drawing in Illustrator's point (page) based coordinate systems and declare the
    viewBox with those coordinates. Fortunately, we don't have to do that. The script
    used to export the code from Illustrator (see the Colophon for details) calculates
    the values and writes out the viewBox for us.</p>
    <p>Finally, note that we have also set up our SVG to receive the "onload" event . The
    handler <span class="inline-code">on_load</span> will be called with a SVG event
    object (which is slightly different than a vanilla HTML event) when the SVG section
    of our EPUB has been loaded.</p>
    <p>The SVG itself is fairly straightforward. The various pieces, the high striker
    boady, labels, <em>etc.</em> are all fairly normal. Two key elements are that the
    "traveller" (the weight that moves up and down) and the sedgehammer are separate
    groups so we can easily animate them. Now, let's look at the JavaScript itself.</p>
    <p>First, the handler for the onload event:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function on_load(evt) {
        svgDoc = getSVGDoc(evt.target);

        sledge    = svgDoc.getElementById('Sledge');
        traveller = svgDoc.getElementById('Traveller');
        info      = svgDoc.getElementById('Velocity');
        bellSound = window.parent.document.getElementById("audio-bell");
        hitSound  = window.parent.document.getElementById('audio-hit');
    }

    function  getSVGDoc(node) {
        if (node.nodeType == 9)
            return node;
        else
            return node.ownerDocument;
    }</code></pre>
    <p>First, we call getSVGDoc to get the SVG document object. Usually, the event object
    passed to our handler is an HTML node which whose owner document is the SVG document,
    but in older browsers it was sometimes the SVG document itself.</p>
    <p>Then we we search for three special SVG elements we want for the animation: the
    traveller, the sledge and a text object we will use to output information about the
    animation as it occurs. We also search for two audio elements so we can play sounds.
    Note that these audio elements are actually in the HTML body, NOT in the SVG. Audio
    support in SVG is a little iffy from browser to browser so it is easier and more
    consistent to put the audio in the HTML and call those elements from our
    JavaScript.</p>
    <p>The next important piece is the handler for the mousedown on the sledge, which we
    use to trigger the animation:</p>
    <pre><code class=
    "language-svg">&lt;g id="Sledge" onmousedown="OnMouseDownSledge(evt)"&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>And the handler looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function OnMouseDownSledge(evt) {
         if (traveling == false) {
            traveling = true;
            setSledge( -90 );

            startTime = new Date();

            initialVelocity = 13.85;

            hitSound.play();

            intervalID = window.setInterval('next_update()', 16);
        }
    }</code></pre>
    <p>We first check that we aren't already in the middle of an animation - if not we
    set the flag to indicate that we have started animating. Then we rotate the
    sledgehammer to hit the fulcrum and start the traveler upwards. We record the start
    time, set the initial velocity to an arbitrary constant that is just sufficient to
    ring the bell. Then we call the HTML audio element to make the sound of the sledge
    hitting the fulcrum. Finally, we call the browser's setInterval function, telling it
    to call the next_update function every 16 milliseconds. The is effectively telling it
    to call as often as it can. It will continue to call that function until we call the
    clearInterval function on the browser and pass the intervalID returned by the call to
    setInterval.</p>
    <p>The setSledge function is quite simple:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function setSledge( angle ) {
        sledge.setAttribute("transform", "rotate("+ angle + " " + sledgeAnchorX + " " + sledgeAnchorY + ")");
}</code></pre>
    <p>It just sets the transform attribute of the sledge's group element to rotate the
    sledge around the sledgeAnchorX and sledgeAnchorY.</p>
    <p>All the real work happens in the next_update method:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function next_update () {
        elapsed = (Date.now() - startTime.getTime()) / 1000.0;

        velocity = initialVelocity - deltaTime * gravity;
        posY = elapsed * initialVelocity - 0.5 * gravity * elapsed * elapsed;
     
        if (posY &gt;= 9.7) {
            posY = 9.7;
            bellSound.play();
        }
        else if (posY &lt;= 0 ) {
            posY = 0;
            traveling = false;
            hitSound.play();
            window.clearInterval( intervalID );
        }

        if (deltaTime &gt; 1.0)
            setSledge(0);

        traveller.setAttribute("y", posY + 0.4778 );
        info.firstChild.nodeValue = ( 't: ' + elapsed.toFixed(1) + ' v: ' 
                + velocity.toFixed(1) + ' y: ' + posY.toFixed(1));
    }</code></pre>
    <p>We first fetch the current time and get the elapsed time in seconds since the
    animation started. We use that to calculate current velocity and from that the
    current y position of the traveler. If the traveler has reached the belll, we make
    sure it doesn't go too far upwards and call the HTML audio element to ring the
    bell.</p>
    <p>If, on the other hand, the traveler has reached the bottom, we ensure it doesn't
    drop further, set the animation flag to false and call the HTML audio element to make
    the thump sound again. The we call the browser with the intervalID to stop the calls
    to next_update.</p>
    <p>Note that we also check to see if one second has passed since the animation
    started and, if so, we put the sledge back where it started.</p>
    <p>Finally, we set the traveler's position and update the info text.</p>
    <p>And that's it! Click on <a href="lesson6-svg.html" title="Lesson 6" target="_self">this link</a> and see the animation in all it's traveling
    glory!</p>
