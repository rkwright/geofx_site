				// Now that we have a scene, we want to look into it. Therefore we need a camera.
				// Three.js offers three camera types:
				//  - PerspectiveCamera (perspective projection)
				//  - OrthographicCamera (parallel projection)
				//  - CombinedCamera (allows to switch between perspective / parallel projection
				//    during runtime)
				// In this example we create a perspective camera. Parameters for the perspective
				// camera are ...
				// ... field of view (FOV),
				// ... aspect ratio (usually set to the quotient of canvas width to canvas height)
				// ... near and
				// ... far.
				// Near and far define the clipping planes of the view frustum. Three.js provides an
				// example (http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/examples/
				// -> canvas_camera_orthographic2.html), which allows to play around with these
				// parameters.
				// The camera is moved 10 units towards the z axis to allow looking to the center of
				// the scene.
				// After definition, the camera has to be added to the scene.
				camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(45, canvasWidth / canvasHeight, 1, 100);

				// https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/materials/MeshBasicMaterial.js)
				// from which we need in this lesson only 'color'.

				// Create a white basic material and activate the 'doubleSided' attribute to force the
				// rendering of both sides of each face (front and back). This prevents the so called
				// 'backface culling'. Usually, only the side is rendered, whose normal vector points
				// towards the camera. The other side is not rendered (backface culling). But this
				// performance optimization sometimes leads to holes in the surface. When this happens
				// in your surface, simply set 'doubleSided' to 'true'.

				// The creation of the square is done in the same way as the triangle, exceptThe creation of the square
				// is done in the same way as the triangle, except  in how we define the square.  There
				// is no Face4 in three.js (for performance reasons).  Instead, we have to define two triangles.
				// Moreover, the triangles	have to have the correct winding or one or the other will effectively be
				// facing "away" (though since we define the mesh as double-sided that wouldn't show). Still, it is not
				// good practice, so one has to ensure that they are have the correct winding direction. So we define
				// the four vertices as ( -1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0),	(1, -1, 0), (-1, -1, 0). Then connect them as (0, 1, 2)
				// as one triangle and (0, 2, 3) as the second triangle.
