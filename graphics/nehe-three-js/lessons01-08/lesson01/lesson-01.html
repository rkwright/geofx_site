 <h2>Lesson  1 - Setting Up WebGL and three.js</h2>
<p>The good news about setting up WebGL and three.js is that there isn't much you have to do. It used to be that in
    order to enable WebGL in the browser you had to choose the right browser (often a beta) and tweak some settings.
    And then it would more or less work. But with the passage of time all the browser vendors (so to speak) have
    enabled OpenGL by default. A couple of the lesser browsers have some limitations on some platforms but generally
    it all &quot;just works&quot;. Yay. For more info see the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl"
                                                                 title="Can I Use WebGL" target="_blank">caniuse site</a>
    and the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/" title="Khronos WebGL" target="_blank">Khronos site</a>.</p>

<p>Getting started with  three.js is very easy - just read this book... :-) There are a lot of tutorials on three.js
    out there and many many demos. For this site, you can read through it and look at the demos. All the source code
    (as well as the sources for this book are available on github. The demo sources are
    <a href="https://github.com/rkwright/nehe-three-js" title="NeHe and three.js" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
