				// Now that we have a scene, we want to look into it. Therefore we need a camera.
				// Three.js offers three camera types:
				//  - PerspectiveCamera (perspective projection)
				//  - OrthographicCamera (parallel projection)
				//  - CombinedCamera (allows to switch between perspective / parallel projection
				//    during runtime)
				// In this example we create a perspective camera. Parameters for the perspective
				// camera are ...
				// ... field of view (FOV),
				// ... aspect ratio (usually set to the quotient of canvas width to canvas height)
				// ... near and
				// ... far.
				// Near and far define the cliping planes of the view frustum. Three.js provides an
				// example (http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/examples/
				// -> canvas_camera_orthographic2.html), which allows to play around with these
				// parameters.
				// The camera is moved 15 units towards the z axis to allow looking to the center of
				// the scene.
				// After definition, the camera has to be added to the scene.

				// To activate the vertex color, we have to set 'vertexColors' attribute to
				// 'THREE.VertexColors'. Otherwise they won't be displayed.

				// Create a basic material, supporting vertex colors. Activate the 'doubleSided'
				// attribute to force the rendering of both sides of each face (front and back).
				// This prevents the so called 'backface culling'. Usually, only the side is
				// rendered, whose normal vector points towards the camera. The other side is not
				// rendered (backface culling). But this performance optimization sometimes leads
				// to wholes in the surface. When this happens in your surface, simply set

				// The creation of the square is done in the same way as the triangle, except that we
