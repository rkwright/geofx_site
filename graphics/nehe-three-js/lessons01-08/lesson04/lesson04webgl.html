				//  - PerspectiveCamera (perspective projection)
				//  - OrthographicCamera (parallel projection)
				//  - CombinedCamera (allows to switch between perspective / parallel projection
				//    during runtime)

				// camera are ...
				// ... field of view (FOV),
				// ... aspect ratio (usually set to the quotient of canvas width to canvas height)
				// ... near and
				// ... far.
				// Near and far define the clipping planes of the view frustum. Three.js provides an
				// example (http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/examples/
				// -> canvas_camera_orthographic2.html), which allows to play around with these
				// parameters.

				// This prevents the so called 'backface culling'. Usually, only the side is
				// rendered, whose normal vector points towards the camera. The other side is not
