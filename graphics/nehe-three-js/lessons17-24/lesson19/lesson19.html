<h2>Lesson 19 - Particle Engines</h2>

<p>A particle system is a technique in game physics, motion graphics,
and computer graphics that uses a large number of very small sprites,
3D models, or other graphic objects to simulate certain kinds of
"fuzzy" phenomena, which are otherwise very hard to reproduce with
conventional rendering techniques - usually highly chaotic systems,
natural phenomena, or processes caused by chemical reactions. The
algorithmic implementation of such particle systems is often referred
to as a particle engine. This lesson is a demonstration of two such
particle engines.</p>
<p>In contrast to the last lesson, this one is fairly complex for two
reasons. First, the support by three.js for particle engines is
relatively primitive so the user has to do a bit more work than for
quadrics. Secondly, the particle engine support in three.js is
relatively simple in that it only support simple image-based sprites.
And those sprites (like the sprites we saw in lesson 13) always face
the camera, so they're not very flexible.</p>
<p>So we'll also implement our own particle engine which will
demonstrate the basic principles. The tradeoff is that while the
three.js particle system can handle a huge number of particles and
still be performant, our own particle engine will bog down with a far
smaller number of particles.</p>
<p>We initialize the gfxScene object same as always. We also declare some global vars:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var ELEV         = 25;
var DELTA_ELEV   = 10;
var FLOOR_REPEAT = 5;
var clock;
var particleSystem;
var cannon       = null;
var beachBall    = null;</code></pre>

<p>We'll go over what each of these is for as we go along. Next step is
to instantiate the scene, which is pretty standard. We do specify a
floor of size 5x5 tiles so we end up with a 20x20 checkerboard. Then we
call initDemo, which is where it gets interesting.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, we instantiate the three.js <span class="inline-code">Clock</span> object:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">clock = new THREE.Clock(true);</code></pre>

<p>We use the clock to control the degree of motion of the three.js
particle system sprites. Then we create a simple wire-frame box mesh (in
red), just as a visual reference. The box is the same size as the
checkerboard floor.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var cubeGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 10, 10, 10 );
var cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { wireframe:true, color : 0xff0000 } );
cube = new THREE.Mesh( cubeGeometry, cubeMaterial );
cube.position.set(0,0,0);
gfxScene.add(cube);</code></pre>

<p>First, we instantiate the three.js particle system by calling <span class="inline-code">createParticleSystem</span>, which returns the particle system "mesh" which we add to the scene.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">particleSystem = createParticleSystem();
gfxScene.add(particleSystem);</code></pre>

<p>Let's look at the code in <span class="inline-code">createParticleSystem</span>.
We first set a "constant" that is the number of particles in the
system. Then we allocate a plain geometry that will hold all the
verticies which are the "particles".</p>


<pre><code class="language-javascript">var PARTICLE_COUNT = 500;
var particles = new THREE.Geometry();</code></pre>

<p>Then we create the vertices and add them to the particle's geometry.
This loop creates all the vertices in a range of -20 to 20 (the size of
the checkerboard floor) in all directions, centered around the origin.</p>
<pre><code xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="language-javascript">var DISTRIBX     = 20;
var DISTRIBZ     = 20;
for (var p = 0; p &lt; PARTICLE_COUNT; p++) {
    var y = Math.random() * ELEV - DELTA_ELEV;
    var x = Math.random() * DISTRIBX - FLOOR_REPEAT * 2;
    var z = Math.random() * DISTRIBZ - FLOOR_REPEAT * 2;
	    
    var particle = new THREE.Vector3(x, y, z);
    particles.vertices.push(particle);
}</code></pre>

<p>
Then we create a material that will be used to render each vertex of
the geometry. The texture we supply is a simple PNG "snowflake" image
that is partially transparent:</p>
<p><img alt="Snowflake image" src="images/snowflake_illus.png" height="195" width="197"></img></p>
	
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var particleMaterial = new THREE.PointsMaterial({ 
    color: 0xffffff,
    size: 0.4,
    map: THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture("images/snowflake.png"),
    blending: THREE.AdditiveBlending,							transparent: true
    });</code></pre>

<p>We make the snowflake white at 40% of its natural size and set it to
be partially transparent so it is blended into the scene. Finally we
create the particle system and return it to be added to the scene.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">particleSystem = new THREE.Points(particles, particleMaterial);return particleSystem;</code></pre>

<p>Before we look at the other particle system, let's take a brief look
at how the three.js particle system gets animated. the work gets done
in <span class="inline-code">animateParticles</span>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function animateParticles() {
    var deltaTime = clock.getDelta();            
    var verts = particleSystem.geometry.vertices;
    
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; verts.length; i++) {
        var vert = verts[i];
        if (vert.y &lt; -10) {
            vert.y = Math.random() * ELEV - DELTA_ELEV;
        }
        
        vert.y = vert.y - deltaTime;
    }
    particleSystem.geometry.verticesNeedUpdate = true;
}</code></pre>


<p>We start by fetching the "deltaTime", which is the time in seconds
since the animation routine was last called. This is usually about
0.016666 since the animation typically runs around 60 fps 1 second
divided by 60 is ~0.016. One of the advantages of using the delta time
is that it more or less automatically adjusts the rate of descent of
the snowflakes so they fall at the same steady rate since the longer it
has been since the last call to delta time, the farther the snowflakes
drops. Since the routine is called ~60 times a second, each snowflake
falls about 1 unit per second and therefore take about 5-10 seconds to
fall through the lower limit (-10).</p>
<p>Then we simply loop through all the verticies adjust the elevation
by the deltaTime factor. For each vertex we check if they have already
reached the bottom limit. If so, we move the vertex back up near the
top. But note that the z and x coordinates are not changed so each
vertex just cycles up and down in straight line.</p>
<p>Finally, we notify three.js that we have adjust the vertex
positions. Otherwise the mesh would not get updated. And that's it for
the three.js particle system.</p>
<p>So now, let's take a look at the significantly more complex
home-brewed particle system. This one consists of a "cannon" poking up
through the checkerboard floor. It fires a steady stream of colored
spheres into the air, randomly altering the speed and direction of the
launched "beach balls". Once launched, the balls are subject to gravity
and fall down to bounce across the floor until they fall off, plunging
into the nether regions.</p>
<p>So let's go through the code - there's a fair amount of it. First,
let's take a look at the beach-balls, as they are quite simple. All the
beach-balls consist of  a three.js Sphere, it's radius, and two
vectors holding the location and velocity of the ball. Here is the
constructor:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">BALL.BeachBall = function ( parameters ) {
    var SEGMENTS        = 8;
    var BASE_RADIUS     = 0.1;
    var DELTA_RADIUS    = 0.025;
    var RESTITUTION     = 0.75;
    
    this.vel      = new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0);
    this.loc      = new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0);
    this.gravity  = new THREE.Vector3(0,-0.002,0);
    this.mesh     = null;
    
    GFX.setParameters(this, parameters);
    
    this.radius = BASE_RADIUS + DELTA_RADIUS * Math.random();
    
    var geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry( this.radius, SEGMENTS, SEGMENTS );
    var material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial( { transparent: true });
    material.color.setRGB(Math.random(), Math.random(), Math.random());
    
    this.mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );    this.restitution = RESTITUTION;
};</code></pre>

<p>Most of this is self-explanatory such as velocity and location, the
number of segments on the sphere and the base and delta radius of the
balls. <span class="inline-code">RESTITUTION</span> is the amount that
the ball will rebound each time it bounces. If the ball were perfectly
elastic (always rebounding to the same height), resititution would be
1.0. In this case, it loses 25% of its bounce each time it hits the
floor. So the bouncing looks like this:</p>

<p><img alt="beachball restitution" src="images/Restitution.svg" width="400"/></p>

<p>The update function for the beach-ball is pretty simple since all it
does is update the location using the current velocity then update the
velocity with the gravitational pull and finally updates the mesh's
position:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">update: function() {
    this.loc.add( this.vel );
    this.vel.add( this.gravity );
    this.mesh.position.set(this.loc.x, this.loc.y, this.loc.z);
}</code></pre>
    
<p>The cannon is more complex since it both launches and manages all the beach-balls. First, we instantiate the cannon itself:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">cannon = new CANNON.Cannon( {
    scene : gfxScene,
    deltaT : 10,
    xLimit : FLOOR_REPEAT,
    zLimit : FLOOR_REPEAT
});
    
gfxScene.add( cannon.mesh );</code></pre>
    
<p>The parameters are the scene itself (since the cannon creates
the beach-balls and adds them to the scene). We also pass in the size
of the floor so the cannon knows when the balls have fallen off the
floor. <span class="inline-code">deltaT</span> basically controls how
fast the cannon tries to fire balls. Making the parameter less than 10
has little effect since the code will only launch one ball per frame no
matter how fast the computer. Making it larger will greatly reduce the
number of balls since the cannon won't launch a ball at every frame.
We'll cover this shortly.</p>
<p>The Cannon object has the following members:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">this.deltaT   = 0.0;
this.lastT    = 0.0;
this.mesh     = null;
this.magazine = [];
this.active   = [];
this.xLimit   = 0;
this.zLimit   = 0;
this.scene    = null;
this.gravity  = new THREE.Vector3(0, -0.002, 0);</code></pre>

<p>Most are self-explanatory, simply providing local storage. The mesh  is the cannon itself.  The <span class="inline-code">magazine</span>
is what it implies, the magazine in which the balls not currently
launched are stored. Those balls that have been launched are kept in
the <span class="inline-code">active</span> array. When a ball falls off the floor and into the nether regions, it is
    moved from the <span class="inline-code">active</span> array into the <span class="inline-code">magazine</span>.
When a new ball is needed and the <span class="inline-code">magazine</span> is empty one is created. If
there is one in the <span class="inline-code">magazine</span>, it is just popped out and re-used. In
this way, we don't waste memory and performance by removing and
re-creating beach-balls. Each ball is created just once. <span class="inline-code">lastT</span>
is the time when we last updated all the balls. As you'll see, we
throttle the updates since there is no sense to updating faster than 60
fps.</p>
<p>First, we create the cannon:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var geometry = new THREE.CylinderGeometry( 
    BASE_RADIUS * 2.0
    BASE_RADIUS * 3.0,
    BARREL_LENGTH,
    32, 1, true);
                        
var material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial( { 
    color : 0xdddddd,
    specular: 0x009900, 
    shininess: 30, 
    side:THREE.DoubleSide});
    
this.mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's look at the update method for the cannon, which is called from the animate() method in the lesson19.
    It's pretty simple, it first calls <span class="inline-code">fireCannon()</span>
    hen <span class="inline-code">updateBalls().</span></p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">update: function() {
    this.fireCannon();
    this.updateBalls();
}</code></pre>

<p>The method <span class="inline-code">fireCannon()</span> is relatively simple, but has a couple of interesting aspects:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">fireCannon : function {
    var now = Performance.now();
    if ((now - this.lastT) &lt; this.deltaT)
        return;
    this.lastT = now;
    
    var newBall;
    if (this.magazine.length > 0) {
        newBall = this.magazine.pop();    
    } 
    else {
        newBall = new BALL.BeachBall( { gravity : this.gravity } );
        this.scene.add( newBall.mesh );
    }
    
    this.initTrajectory( newBall );
    this.active.push( newBall );
}</code></pre>

<p>The first step is to see if the delay since the last firing is long enough, i.e. longer than <span class="inline-code">deltaT</span>.
    If not, we just return. If has been long enough (which is usually the case), we need to fire the cannon. To do this, we first
    check if there is already one or more balls in the <span class="inline-code">magazine</span>. If so, we just pop one out of the
    <span class="inline-code">magazine</span>. If the <span class="inline-code">magazine</span> is empty (which is only true
    in the first few seconds of the demo) we need to allocate a brand new beach ball and add it to the scene.</p>
<p>Then we initialize the trajectory of the beach-ball, i.e. we &quot;fire&quot; the beach-ball. We  want the balls to come out the mouth of the cannon of
course, but at different vertical angles and with some random
variation. The geometry of this looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Cannon Rho" src="images/Cannon-Rho.svg" height="450" width="300"/></p>
<p>This is the code.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">initTrajectory: function ( ball ) {
    var MUZZLE_VELOCITY = 0.125;
    
    var MIN_RHO         = 45.0 * Math.PI / 180.0;
    var DELTA_RHO       = 30.0 * Math.PI / 180.0;


    var rho = MIN_RHO + DELTA_RHO * Math.random();
    var velY = Math.sin(rho) * MUZZLE_VELOCITY;
    var velH = MUZZLE_VELOCITY - velY;


    var theta = Math.PI * 2.0 * Math.random();
    var velX = Math.sin(theta) * velH;
    var velZ = Math.cos(theta) * velH;


    ball.vel.set( velX, velY, velZ);
    ball.loc.set(0,ball.radius, 0);

    ball.mesh.material.opacity = 1;
}</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty straightforward. The trajectory of the ball is detemined by the muzzle velocity and the angle of the
    trajectory.  <span class="inline-code">Rho</span> determines both the vertical and horizontal velocities.
    <span class="inline-code">Theta</span> determines the direction of the ball. Note that <span class="inline-code">deltaRho</span>
    is less than 45 degrees. Otherwise too many of the balls go more or less vertical and end up rolling too slowly
    towards the edge of the floor. Finally, we push the newly fired beach ball into the <span class="inline-code">active</span> array.</p>
<p>In <span class="inline-code">updateBalls</span>, we walk through the array of active balls. For each ball, we first
    check if the ball is now completely transparent. If so it has fallen off the floor and disappeared. So we move it from
    the <span class="inline-code">active</span> array to the <span class="inline-code">magazine</span> to be re-used. </p>
<p>If it is not transparent, we update the ball's velocity and position by calling the ball's <span class="inline-code">update</span>
    method. If the ball's height above the floor is less than the radius, we check if the ball is still on the floor.
    If it is we bounce it by inverting the vertical (y) velocity less the ball's restitution. Then we place the ball
    exactly on the floor.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the ball is NOT over the floor anymore, then it is not bounced but instead accelerates downward under
    the force of gravity. Each time it's transparency is reduced by 2.5% until it finally disappears.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
for ( var i=this.active.length-1; i&gt;=0; i-- ) {

    var ball = this.active[i];

    if (ball.mesh.material.opacity &lt;= 0) {
        this.active.splice(i, 1);
        this.magazine.push( ball );
    }
    else {
        ball.update();

        if (ball.loc.y &lt; ball.radius) {
                
            if (Math.abs(ball.loc.x) &lt;= this.xLimit &amp;&amp; Math.abs(ball.loc.z) &lt;= this.zLimit) {
                ball.vel.y = -ball.vel.y * ball.restitution;
                ball.loc.y = ball.radius;
            }
            else { 
                ball.mesh.material.opacity -= 0.025;
            }
        }
    }
}</code>
