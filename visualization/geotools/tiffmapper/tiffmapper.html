	<h2>TIFF Mapper</h2>
	<p>TIFF Mapper is a relatively simple tool that uses the TIFF Reader to open and load a file, then loads the data (16-bit integers) from the file one line at a time. The data is then used to build a three.js Geometry by explicitly creating all the Vector3, Face3 and FaceVertex UVs.</p>
	<p><em>More  details of this are coming soon.</em></p>
	<p>One can also optionally load an image which can be draped onto the mesh.</p>
	<p>A fully functional demo (assuming your browser supports JavaScript and WebGL) is <a href="demo/GeoTIFFTest/TIFFMapper-Test.html" title="TIFFF Mapper demo" target="_blank">here</a>. Be patient, it takes a few seconds (depending on your hardware) to load and render the model. You can zoom in and out with your mouse (or trackpad). The exaggeration is 100x.</p>
	<p>Here is a sample view with the elevations exaggerated 100x. If you don't exaggerate the elevations the earth is almost a smooth as a ping-pong ball. See additional discussion <a href="../projections/projections.html" title="Projections page" target="_self">here</a>.

	<p>Here is another sample, with the same exaggeration as used on the bronze earth sculpture Geo-F/X helped construct currently on display at the New York Museum of Natural History. See <a href="../../sculpture/bronze-sculptures.html" title="Bronze Sculpture" target="_self">here</a> for more details.</p>

  <br/>
	<p>Finally, here is a sample with no exaggeration at all. At this scale, the height of Mount Everest on a 12&quot; (30 cm) globe would be just over 0.01&quot; (0.4 mm). With no exaggeration one might as well use a smooth sphere.</p>

	<p>The GeoTIFF data was obtained from the <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/globe.html" title="GLOBE Project" target="_blank">GLOBE project</a>. The high-res earth images were obtained from JHT'S <a href="http://planetpixelemporium.com/earth.html" title="Planetary Pixel Emporium" target="_blank">Planetary Pixel Emporium</a>. The TIFFReader is based on the <a href="https://github.com/constantinius/geotiff.js" title="GeoTIFF library" target="_blank">geotiff.js</a> library of Fabian Schindler (<a href="https://github.com/constantinius" title="Fabian Schindler at github" target="_blank">constantinius</a>).
