	<h2>Projections</h2>
	<p>Map projections are a powerful and essential tool for GIS development. Geo-F/X has a
   complete library of support for map projections. This library is based on the 
   USGS&rsquo; General Cartographic Transformation Package and the EPSG. 
  </p>
  <p>Supported projections include almost all common datums and ellipsoids as well 
   as most common projections, including all NAD27 and NAD83 state plane projections and 
   UTM projections.
  </p>
  <p>The section below is small sample of some of the world projections supported. The 
    image is based on the NGDC 5 minute DEM data of the world, rendered by a Geo-F/X 
    algorithm and displayed using a variety of map projections. For a brief description 
    of how these were produced, <a href="projection_info.html">click here</a>. To see a 
    large version of the image, simply click on the thumbnails adjacent to the 
    short description.

      </td>
      <td>The Mercator projection is familiar as it is very widely used. It is characterized 
        by straight meridians and parallels that intersect at right angles. Scale is true 
        at the equator or at two standard parallels equidistant from the equator. 
        The projection is often used for marine navigation because all straight lines 
        on the map are lines of constant azimuth

      </td>
      <td>The Miller projection, like the Mercator, has straight meridians and parallels 
        that meet at right angles, but straight lines are not of constant azimuth. Shapes 
        and areas are distorted. Directions are true only along the equator, but the 
        projection avoids the scale exaggerations of the Mercator projection.

      <td>The Robinson projection is what is called a pseudo-projection because it is 
        not purely geometric formulae, but is based on tables of coordinates. The 
        projection has been designed to balance the distortion of shape, area, scale, 
        and distance.

      </td>
      <td>The Mollweide projection, based on a secant azimuthal method is often used for 
        world maps because it tends to retain the shapes of areas. Scale is true only 
        along the standard parallels of 41 N and 41 S.
