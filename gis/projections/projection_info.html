	<p>The map projection demos were created by converting the publicly available 5 minute DEM data (courtesy of the <a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov">NGDC)</a> from the original plain raster format to a registered GeoTIFF image file.&nbsp; The resulting file is read by proprietary Geo-F/X tools and projected using the Geo-F/X projection library.&nbsp; The projection is done in 3D (using OpenGL)&nbsp;&nbsp; The elevations in the DEM file are used to depict the elevations.&nbsp; In the other demos the vertical elevations are exaggerated by 15x - otherwise the earth&rsquo;s topography is virtually undetectable.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;gnarly&rdquo; globe above the elevations are exaggerated 100 times!</p>
	<p>The color rendering of the globe is achieved by applying a simple model that relates the earth&rsquo;s biogeographical distribution to latitude and altitude and assigns colors based on the dominant biogeographical elements of each zone (e.g. desert/scrub brown, tropical forest green, temperate forest dark green, etc.)</p>
