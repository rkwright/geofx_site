	<h2>eBooks</h2>

    <p>While at Adobe, Geo-F/X's principal, Ric Wright, formed and led the small team that created the first commercial eBook reading system for the creation, delivery and rights-protection of eBooks based on EPUB.  The team developed Adobe's Reader Mobile SDK (RMSDK) which has been the basis of many of the eBook reading systems on the market today.  The team also developed the Digital Rights Management  software, Adobe Content Server (ACS) which still serves as the industry standard for DRM. The team also created Adobe Digital Editions, which is still the mostly widely used desktop application for reading eBooks.</p>
    <p> Ric's role in that effort was to lead the engineering effort, aid in the development, especially on the client, supervise testing, write most of the documents, and champion the effort both within Adobe and across the industry.</p>
