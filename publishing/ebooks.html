  <p>While at Adobe, Geo-F/X's principal, Ric Wright, formed and led the small team that 
    created the first commercial eBook reading system for the creation, delivery and
    rights-protection of eBooks based on EPUB.  The team developed Adobe's Reader Mobile 
    SDK (RMSDK) which has been the basis of many of the eBook reading systems on the 
    market today.  The team also developed the Digital Rights Management  software, 
    Adobe Content Server (ACS) which still serves as the industry standard for DRM. 
    The team also created Adobe Digital Editions, which is still the mostly widely 
    used desktop application for reading eBooks.
  </p>
  <p> Ric's role in that effort was to lead the engineering effort, aid in the 
    development, especially on the client, supervise testing, write most of the 
    documents, and champion the effort both within Adobe and across the industry.
