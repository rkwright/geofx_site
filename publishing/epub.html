	<h2>EPUB</h2>
    <br/>
	<p><a href="http://idpf.org/epub">EPUB</a> is the distribution and interchange format standard for digital publications and documents based on Web Standards. EPUB defines a means of representing, packaging and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content — including XHTML, CSS, SVG, images, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file format.</p>
    <p>Geo-F/X's principal, Ric Wright, is one of the original members of the IDPF EPUB working group.  He has played an instrumental role in creating both the EPUB 2 and EPUB 3 specifications,  He continues this role today as the WG continues with the EDUPUB profile and EPUB 3.1.</p>
    <p>While at Adobe, he championed the nascent EPUB specification and led the team that created the first implementation of an EPUB Reading System in Adobe Digitial Editions and the Sony Reader PS-500.</p>
