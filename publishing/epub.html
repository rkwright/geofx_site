	<h2>EPUB</h2>
  <br/>
	<p><a href="http://idpf.org/epub">EPUB</a> is the distribution and interchange format 
    standard for digital publications and documents based on Web Standards. EPUB defines 
    a means of representing, packaging and encoding structured and semantically enhanced 
    Web content — including XHTML, CSS, SVG, images, and other resources — for distribution 
    in a single-file format.
  </p>
    
  <p>Geo-F/X's principal, Ric Wright, is one of the original members of the IDPF EPUB 
    working group.  He has played an instrumental role in creating both the EPUB 2 and 
    EPUB 3 specifications,  He continues this role today as the WG continues with the 
    EDUPUB profile and EPUB 3.1.
  </p>
    
  <p>While at Adobe, he championed the nascent EPUB specification and led the team that 
    created the first implementation of an EPUB Reading System in Adobe Digitial Editions 
    and the Sony Reader PS-500.
