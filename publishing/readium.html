	<h2>Readium</h2>
    <br/>
    
   <p>The <a href="http://www.readium.org">Readium Foundation</a> was founded to develop technology to accelerate adoption of EPUB 3 and the Open Web Platform by the global digital publishing industry. Readium.org was formed in February, 2013 as a non-profit membership organization. Current Readium.org projects include Readium Web (an EPUB 3 rendering engine for browser-based cloud readers), Readium SDK (an EPUB 3 rendering engine for native apps) as well as LCP a DRM technology designed to work with the Readium-based reading systems.</p>
	<p>Ric has been the director of all the engineering efforts since the foundation's inception.  This includes all aspects to the development, including code review, designs, documentation, testing and collaboration with the more than 70 companies and several dozen engineers involved in the project.</p>
