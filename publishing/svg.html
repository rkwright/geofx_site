	<h2>SVG</h2>

 	<p>Geo-F/X's principal, Ric Wright, was one of the original members of the 
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a> working group,  He contributed to 
    the creation of the SVG 1.0 specification as well as Adobe's implementation of 
    the specification, the Adobe SVG Viewer.
  </p>
    
  <p>Even more importantly, Ric wrote most of the libraries used for import and export 
    of SVG in all of Adobe's authoring tools, including Illustrator, InDesign ad LiveMotion. 
    In addition, Ric was seconded to the Illustrator team for two releases, writing and 
    testing the import/export code for two major releases of Illustrator.
  </p>
  
  <p>Finally, Ric designed and implemented, circa 2002, a multi-paned authoring tool for 
    SVG named Humboldt.  It supported multiple views (in tabs) of the document, including
    WYSIWYG authoring in one tab, and an editable DOM viewable as a tree or plain text 
    as well as a fully-functional JavaScript debugger (based on Mozilla's SpiderMonkey) 
    with support for breakpoints and  variables.  Unfortunately, Adobe decided not to 
    release Humboldt.
