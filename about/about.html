    <p>Ric Wright is currently the Director of Engineering for the <a href="http://www.readium.org">Readium Foundation</a>, where he is leading the effort to develop open-source EPUB rendering engines for use in both devices and browsers.  The Readium effort is a collaborative engineering effort knitting together more than 70 companies and developers from all over the globe.  Ric was also a long-standing member of the <a href="http://idpf.org">International Digital Publishing Foundation (IDPF)</a> working group for EPUB, a role he continues that the IDPF has been merged into the W3C.</p>

<p>Prior to leading the Readium effort, Ric was a senior engineering manager and developer at Adobe Systems of San Jose, California.  At Adobe he founded and led the development of Adobe Digital Editions, the Reader Mobile SDK (RMSDK), and Adobe Content Server, the current industry standard for Digital Rights Management (DRM) in eBooks.  Ric is also a member of the original IDPF EPUB working group that produced both the the <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/301">EPUB 2 and 3</a> specifications.  Ric was also instrumental in the development of the W3C standard for <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">scalable vector graphics (SVG)</a> and wrote most of the support in Adobe authoring tools for SVG. He also contributed to the Adobe SVG Viewer Project as a developer. </p>
